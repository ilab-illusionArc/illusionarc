            </h2>
            <p class="mt-3">
              Illusion Arc discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
              those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
              order to process it on Illusion Arc's behalf or to provide services available at Illusion Arc's website, and
              (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
              organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Illusion Arc's website, you consent to
              the transfer of such information to them. Illusion Arc will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
              and personally-identifying information to anyone.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Illusion Arc
              discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
              subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Illusion Arc believes in good faith that
              disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Illusion Arc, third parties or the
              public at large.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              If you are a registered user of <span class="font-medium">https://www.illusionarc.com/</span> and have
              supplied your email address, Illusion Arc may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
              solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Illusion Arc and our products.
              We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
              to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
              mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
              help us support other users.
